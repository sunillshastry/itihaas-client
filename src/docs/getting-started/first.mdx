Welcome to the official documentation for the Itihaas API, a powerful and developer-friendly interface for accessing structured data about dynasties, rulers, and wars in Indian history. This API is designed to be simple to integrate, intuitive to explore, and robust enough for research, educational platforms, history-based applications, or general curiosity.

This section provides everything you need to get started: how to view the docs, make your first requests, understand responses, registering for an API key, and follow best practices for effective use.

The documentation is organized into logical sections for easy browsing and reference during usage. All public endpoints that are supported on Itihaas are listed under the API Reference guide section available in the sidebar. Each reference category includes

- Concise description on what the endpoint does.
- The HTTP method (although **most** available endpoints are `GET` methods).
- The endpoint path itself (Itihaas API follows the _REST_ architecture).
- Any optional query parameters.
- Sample request example(s).
- Sample response example(s).
- Additional usage tips and potential edge case behaviors.
