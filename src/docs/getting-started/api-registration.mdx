In this section, we will discuss how to register for the API and the prerequisites. To actually get started and consume the Itihaas API in your applications, you must first register for an API key. Registering for an API key is free of cost, and can be done so by providing your name, email address and an optional usage reason. To ensure API security, misuse and server stability, a **daily request limit of 100 requests** has been set per API key.

The key uniquely identifies you as a user and allows us to manage request limits, monitor usage patterns, and ensure that our services remain fast, stable, and secure for everyone. We highly recommend that you do not share your unique API keys with anyone. **Please avoid exposing it in public Git repositories, environment files (publicly), or anywhere that is publicly accessible for misuse. The Itihaas API keys are sensitive credentials and should be treated like passwords. Unauthorized use of your key may lead to rate limiting, data abuse, or even revocation.**

If you have any queries or concerns regarding the API, you can contact us via the [API Issues](/issues/api) form.

To register for an API key and learn more, please visit our [API Registration](/register) page.

Alternatively, if you have previously registered for an API key and have misplaced it, you can retrieve it back through our [API Recovery](/api-recovery) page.
